This is a 2D fighting game developed in Unity using C#, created by a group of four students.
Players can select from multiple fighters, each with unique abilities, and battle against AI or each other. 
The game features combo attacks, blocking, health management, and a special double-damage mechanic triggered by specific key combinations.

To ensure a clean and maintainable architecture, several design patterns were implemented:

State Pattern to manage character states like idle, walking, attacking, and dying.

Command Pattern to handle user input and actions like attacking and blocking.

Strategy Pattern to define and manage different attack styles per character.

Abstract Factory Pattern to generate related attack strategies for each fighter.

Observer Pattern to update the health UI in real time as fighters take damage.

Decorator Pattern to apply enhancements like double-damage effects on attacks.

This combination of gameplay mechanics and design patterns resulted in a well-structured and engaging combat experience.
